# Manifesto

Published: 

In this post, I will share my design philosophy and how I wish to approach digital design problems in the future. This is from my experience in this space designing and developing digital products. 

In my Software Engineering undergraduate degree filled mathematics and technical courses, I took a class called Development for Usability. The class was about learning the principles of usability and prototyping of digital products. Usability is part of the broader term “user experience” and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website. I'm lucky to have taken the class because I was encouraged to approach problems with a creative mindset.

## Design Principles

These are the design principles I belive in and follow

1. Put the user first

    Design is about solving problems, resist putting your preferences. Understand your users by observing or interviewing them.

2. Use a design system

    Design system will speed up work, saves time and promotes consistency. 

3. Prototyping is your best friend

    It will help you find problem in your products or feature lacking.

4. Add personality to your work

    Every websites, every app looks the same. Go on [behance.com](http://behance.com) or [dribbble.com](dribbble.com) all the digital deisgn look the same, with slight changes to the colour. Design should have personality and character like fashion, when you use a digital product you should have a clue who designed it.

5. Follow the humane design guideline

    The humane design guideline is a resource that provides guidance for designing ethically humane digital products through patterns focused on user well-being. With the growth in mobile technology where time and attention is an increasingly scarce resource. Instead of making us better as humans. It is exploiting out phsycolosgical vulnerabilities.

    As designers, we play a vital role in that space. It is our duty to build products that serve us not harm us.

6. Do what makes you happy

    Solve problems that inspire you, find challenges you want to beat. 

## Exhibition

I wanted to design a digital exhibition that can be experienced through screens. Thankfully I have been reading up and experimenting with generative art. "Generative art is art made using a predetermined system that often includes an element of chance (Tate, n.d.)."  The exhibition is to display art through screen. And simulate the feeling of being in a physical art exhibition by showing them in frames.

Using the power of randomness I built a program to generate primitive shapes with random height, width and radius and picking colours randomly from a colour palette.

This exhibition is to show people computers can create art and it is exciting and fascinating to see what  it creates because it is unpredictable and not predefined. This opens door to what and how people think about art. My exhibition is tiny piece of what can be done in this space.
