# Timeline: Journey into Streetwear

## Brief

In my Creative Thinking class I was tasked to design, create and present a personal timeline that highlights and evidences my own timeline of movers, shakers, innovators, critical thinkers and influencers. 

## Thought Process

The first idea that came to me for this task is to breakdown my life in different stages from birth till now and recollect what I was into at that period from friends, music, movies and people around me to find my movers, shakers, innovators, critical thinkers and influencers. I soon realised that's somewhat impossible. 

**Why not fashion?** The first thing most people do the first time they see or meet someone is look at what they are wearing. From what people wear you can have a clue what they are into and their influence.

### Fashion Influence

I have always been interested in fashion but I didn't have the immediate stores around me in my country Nigeria, the only time I buy clothes is when I travel abroad. I was really limited by that fact. I moved to United Kingdom September 2015 to study. That was when I started investing and experimenting to find my style in clothes and shoes I wear. I started by looking into what was in trend in fashion and shopping pieces off high street brands like H&M, Topman, New Look, River Island and ASOS. 

Through time and experimentation I started to move closely into streetwear. Streetwear is a style of casual clothing which became global in the 1990s. It grew from Californian and skate culture, but also encompasses elements of hip-hop fashion, modern high fashion and haute couture (Marie Hartwell-Walker, 2020). In the recent years is experiencing and explosive popularity due a particular brand called Supreme. 

Looking through the lens and looking through my photos, I designed an infographic of my journey into fashion.
