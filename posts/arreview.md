# Archive Research: Review

## Description

I received an underwhelming response for my presentation on the archive brief. Which you can find here. I decided to find the cause and learn from it.

## Interpretation

The problem was not from time management. I booked and viewed the archive of my choice early enough to produce an interesting and meaningful presentation. So, I had enough time to work on this brief.

To me, the significant issue is that maybe the tutors didn't understand what I was trying to convey because of the method I used. I try to keep my presentations short and precise. It helps to hold the listener's attention(Atherton, 2009). I believe the system I used for my presentation is the cause for the underwhelming feedback.

Also, the original archive I was meant to view didn't spark any ideas on how to carry the materials into a further study. I had to change the materials of the archive when I went to view the materials. I believe reading up about the archive before viewing could have prevented this issue. I decided to view and observe the materials without reading up about it to avoid any preconceived idea.

To get to the bottom of this problem I showed and asked my course-mates about my presentation. I asked them what their thoughts were about it and if they had any idea why the tutors were not content with my presentation. I received a different response from each person and took notes of them.

### These are the responses I received:

1. "I think it was too short"
2. "You didn't describe clearly why you picked the subject and the archive"
3. 'You assumed everybody knew/knows bauhaus design"
4. "The images in one slide was too cluttered to understand"
5. "You were speaking a bit fast"

After gathering these responses I sat down and viewed my presentation slides and tried to make a correlation. See fig 1. which shows the cluttered images on the slide, I used a transition for each image, they didn't appear together at once. It is still valid feedback because I could have done better, for example using two images per slide. The presentation is short was to hold the listeners' attention as stated before. I didn't have a content page and that caused me to skip valuable explanations for why I chose the archive.

It later became clear to me I used a conference-style presentation instead of a project style. I paid more attention thinking I only have audience and forgetting it is a project and I will be under scrutiny. It happened as a result of the tips I saw on the internet which were not for project-based presentations.

## Outcome

Most Importantly, I have learned that peer feedback is an important aspect of learning. Peer feedback means that feedback is given by one student to another, through comments made on each other work, behaviour or performances(Liu and Carless, 2006). Peer feedback can help students develop that all-important appreciation of what counts as high-quality work in the discipline or subject area (Sadler, 1989), while at the same time enabling them 'to take an active role in the management of their learning(Liu and Carless, 2006). I'm in a University environment where sharing and learning together is part of it. I could have easily asked a course-mate to peer review my presentation and doing that could have eliminated the issue I faced when presenting my results. I would have received feedback to improve or change my presentation slides. Having analysed and discussed the cause of the problem I now know the cause and solution to the problem.

Overall, this brief was the most challenging one I have done so far and it introduced me to the value of peer feedback. Looking back, I believe my results for the archive brief would have been way better if I had a better presentation slide. I learned a lot from how to undertake archival research and making notes of my observations and thoughts. Also thinking beyond the scope of the research and material I viewed and finding a way to carry it further into a useful study.

I decided to edit my slide using the feedback I received and you can find it here.
