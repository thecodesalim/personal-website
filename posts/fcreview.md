# First Cut: Review

## Working in a Group

The goal of working in a group is to increase performance and productivity by planning and problem solving while collectively working together.
There are great advantages to working in a group. I alone can only think of so many ideas, but a group of 5 individuals discussing ideas between each other can think of countless ideas. Bouncing concepts off of one another and collectively coming together to select the best one, then expanding on that concept is really what group work is about.

## Presentation

After presenting our presentation for the brief, the tutor reinstated the objective of the brief. The tutor said the objective of the brief is to see the progress of researching and negotiating as a team together. Which our presentation was not about, our presentation was about finding a solution for a problem which is almost the opposite of the objective for the brief.

This approach we used as a team was initiated by one member of the group. The group member said this was the approach they used for this type of project. I feel the problem started here because none of us questioned the approach or critically thought about it. Is it the right way for this project? as a team, we all went with the flow and shared the work.

Ultimately, our group achieved a semi-successful outcome, the tutor said he liked our vlog and stop motion video we created for the project. Our failure arose from us not having a clear understanding of the brief and questioning the rationale behind the person that suggested the methodology for the brief.

Moving forward when I'm working in a group I'll make sure as a team we go through the brief together to draw a complete understanding of what we are undertaking and objectives before brainstorming . for ideas and starting the work.
