# Brand You: M&S Food

Published:

## Workshop

HOW ARE YOU DEFINED THROUGH THE BRANDS THAT YOU USE? is the question asked in the "Brand You" workshop. The workshop is about understanding brands you patronage and asking yourself why you do so. The workshop started by splitting us into groups of 4 and individually listing out all the brands we buy into. And how they define my life as human being and a consumer.

### Question

Consider the task for 30 minutes, and then produce one visual to present your
overall findings to the group. Following this form groups and each group is to
select one brand from those presented to analyse with a view to revealing the
core elements of the brand, using the framework and tools provided.

### Research

I listed out several brands I buy into, then it transformed it into different categories such as clothing brands, apps, etc. But the main point of this workshop is it to pick one from the list and break it down into product/service benefits, positioning, attributes, mission, vision and values.

Choosing only one from the list was a daunting task. I decided to use M&S Food, the food branch of M&S. Marks and Spencer Group plc (commonly abbreviated as M&S or colloquially Marks and Sparks) is a major British multinational retailer with headquarters in Westminster, London that specialises in selling high quality clothing, home products and food products. 

### Why M&S Food?

For the past 3 years I shop for groceries and household items from Tesco, Asda and Coop, I recently moved to London and the nearest grocery store to me is M&S Food. I decided to go in and shop, the first thing that captured my attention outside was the a big banner talking about M&S promises to sustainability(see Fig. 1 & 2). I stepped into the store and I was set aback by their service, cleanliness, products and promise on sustainability. I felt joyous inside the shop, I have never felt that feeling in any supermarket chain. It was an elevated experience.

### Product / Service Benefit

What I understand by product benefit as a customer is the reason why I buy their products and the uniqueness that sets it apart from the competition.

As a new loyal customer of M&S food the benefit I get from the brand is:

1. Quality

    The main reason I buy into this brand is the quality of their products. As reported in the 2018 Brand Loyalty Index by Sodexo Engage M&S tops the list with customer saying they are loyal to the company because of its high quality products(Ainsworth, 2018). 

2. Value for Money

    M&S is a Premium Brand and by that I mean they give their customers the best features at the best value. They operate with a close to one ratio of functionality and price. So since they are providing the best features and quality, consumers pay them high price for that. They also reinforce this feeling of premium by advertisement on their bags when you shop (see Fig. 3). Even though their prices are higher than tesco, sainsburys, asda, lidl/adl, etc I'm still happy to patronise them.

3. Make a Difference

    M&S is the first and only neutral carbon company. Plan A is an ethical programme M&S lauched in 2007 to tackles both today’s and tomorrow’s sustainable retail challenge([Global.marksandspencer.com](http://global.marksandspencer.com/), 2020).

### Positioning / Attributes

The brand sells food and household items. They package most of their products with paper instead of plastics, which makes their presentation look better and is part of their sustainability goal. The way products are presented play a vital role on how consumers behave towards it.

They are different brands competing in this market. Tesco, Sainsburys, Coop, Aldi/Lidl and Waitrose. It is a well known fact M&S Food is far superior in quality compared to Tesco, Sainsburys, Coop and Aldi/Lid and it is seen from their premium price. 

M&S Food main competitor is Waitrose, which also positions itself the same way as M&S providing high quality products with the same premium price. And targeting the same group people M&S Food does. The difference between the two is M&S own-brand items have better quality and their food is better seasoned compared to Waitrose(this sentence is backed-up by my personal experience). 

While working on this workshop I stumbled upon several forums discussing about "which one is posher  Waitrose vs M&S Food and the result is always M&S Food wining, a fine detail I wanted to add and you could search it up also.

### Mission / Vision

M&S value is highly invested into making their customers feel premium and branding themselves as a premium line for products and services. One of the keys to the development of Marks & Spencer over the years has been the ability of the brand to meet the ever-changing needs of a broad customer base. 

The brand's 'vision' is to provide a standard against which its competitors may be measured, from customer experience, to care for the environment and community and to the working environment for employees. This can backed-up by their promise to sustainability and high quality products.

### Values

The core brand values of quality, value, service, innovation and trust have consistently remained the cornerstones of the Marks & Spencer proposition. 

M&S as a brand has existed for over 100 years, adapting and evolving over time. This long-time heritage helps them to understand their broad customer bases ever-changing needs.

### Conclusion

As a consumer you are defined through the brands you buy into for these reasons: 

1. They make connection with you and make you feel special.
2. They project what you stand for.
